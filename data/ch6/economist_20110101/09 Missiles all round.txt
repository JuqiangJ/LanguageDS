Israel, Hamas and Hizbullah

Missiles all round

All sides have kept the peace by building up their arms

ISRAEL has enjoyed unusual quiet on its northern and southern borders since its short, bruising wars against Hizbullah, the Lebanese guerrilla force, in 2006, and Hamas, the Islamist Palestinian faction ruling Gaza, two years later. Yet many fear that the calm is illusory. "The next round won't be focused on one theatre but rather will incorporate two or three," warned Israel's outgoing head of military intelligence, Amos Yadlin, in November. "It will be much bigger, much wider in scope, and with many more casualties."

Such warnings should be taken seriously. Rearmament is proceeding apace. Hizbullah, which lobbed some 4,000 projectiles at Israel in its five-week war, is thought now to deploy 40,000-50,000 rockets. These are mostly short-range-those well behind UN peacekeeping lines could not reach the Israeli border, so would have to be smuggled forward. But its Zelzal II missiles, supplied by Syria and Iran, carry payloads of up to 600kg and are accurate to within 100 metres at a range of 200km. Hamas's far smaller arsenal has a few rockets that can reach Tel Aviv, Israel's largest city. In December an Israeli tank was struck from Gaza by a Russian-made, laser-guided Kornet missile, a sophisticated weapon used to great effect by Hizbullah, but hitherto absent from Gaza.

Israel itself has long been superior in weaponry and manpower. In 2006 it destroyed nearly all of Hizbullah's long-range rockets on the first day of fighting. Since then it has also muscled up, bolstered by American military aid, new attack helicopters and heavier guided bombs. The best of its armour is now protected by systems to deflect anti-tank missiles, and Israel is erecting a three-tier missile-defence shield against long, medium and short-range rockets-helped by $405m in extra American funding.
