China's souped-up car market gets detuned

EVEN by the standards of China's relentlessly booming car market, the first three weeks of December in Beijing were frenzied. New cars sold at double the usual rate. Dealers ran out of stock as customers flooded into showrooms. Many buyers offered to pay extra to guarantee quick delivery. This week, however, sales have slumped.

Beijing residents were rushing to beat the introduction on December 24th of a new lottery system for issuing car licence plates. This will restrict registrations to just 240,000 additional vehicles in 2011, a third of the current annual level. New registrations are only being given to those who have paid tax and social insurance in the city for more than five years. At one stroke this has taken 10m potential buyers out of the market. Sales to government offices are also being frozen. Cars licensed in other parts of China are now forbidden from driving during peak hours in the capital's main urban area.

The new measures are mainly aimed at Beijing's growing traffic congestion. The city's motorists had 4.7m vehicles at the end of November, 6% more than in August. Gridlock has become as bad as in Mexico City (as has pollution). 

Car sales elsewhere in China could also suffer soon. National subsidies on small-car sales will end on January 1st. For several years Shanghai has been auctioning licence plates and, with prices averaging a record 46,000 yuan ($6,900) recently, other cities are keen to follow suit. Guangzhou, Shenzhen and Hangzhou are toying with congestion charges. Ningbo is even considering forcing citizens to own a parking space before they can buy a car. China's new middle class could find its cherished status symbol harder to obtain.
