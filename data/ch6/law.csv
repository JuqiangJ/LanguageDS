        第三十一条     承诺对要约的内容作出非实质性变更的，除要约人及时表示反对或者要约表明承诺不得对要约的内容作出任何变更的以外，该承诺有效，合同的内容以承诺的内容为准。,"Article 31 If the acceptance does not substantially modifies the contents of the offer, it shall be effective, and the contents of the contract shall be subject to those of the acceptance, except as rejected promptly by the offeror or indicted in the offer that an acceptance may not modify the offer at all. "
        第三十二条     当事人采用合同书形式订立合同的，自双方当事人签字或者盖章时合同成立。,"Article 32 Where the parties conclude a contract in written form, the contract is established when both parties sign or affix a seal on it. "
        第三十三条     当事人采用信件、数据电文等形式订立合同的，可以在合同成立之前要求签订确认书。签订确认书时合同成立。,"Article 33 Where the parties conclude the contract in the form of a letter or data-telex, etc., one party may request to sign a letter of confirmation before the conclusion of the contract. The contract shall be established at the time when the letter of confirmation is signed. "
        第三十四条     承诺生效的地点为合同成立的地点。采用数据电文形式订立合同的，收件人的主营业地为合同成立的地点；没有主营业地的，其经常居住地为合同成立的地点。当事人另有约定的，按照其约定。,"Article 34 The place of effectiveness of an acceptance shall be the place of the establishment of the contract. If the contract is concluded in the form of data-telex, the main business place of the recipient shall be the place of establishment.

Where the parties agree otherwise, the place of establishment shall be subject to that agreement. "
        第三十五条     当事人采用合同书形式订立合同的，双方当事人签字或者盖章的地点为合同成立的地点。,"Article 35 Where the parties conclude a contract in written form, the place where both parties sign or affix a seal shall be the place where the contract is established. "

"
        第三十七条     采用合同书形式订立合同，在签字或者盖章之前，当事人一方已经履行主要义务，对方接受的，该合同成立。,"Article 37 A contract, which is concluded in written form, shall be established, if one party has performed its principal obligation and the other party has received it before signiture or affixing with a seal. "

"
        第三十九条     采用格式条款订立合同的，提供格式条款的一方应当遵循公平原则确定当事人之间的权利和义务，并采取合理的方式提请对方注意免除或者限制其责任的条款，按照对方的要求，对该条款予以说明。格式条款是当事人为了重复使用而预先拟定，并在订立合同时未与对方协商的条款。,"Article 39 Where standard terms are adopted in concluding a contract, the party which supplies the standard terms shall define the rights and obligations between the parties abiding by the principle of faimess, request the other party to note the exclusion or restriction of its liabilities in reasonable ways, and explain the standard terms according to the requirement of the other party. Standard terms are clauses which are prepared in advance for general and repeated use by one party and which are not negotiated with the other party in concluding a contract. "
        第四十条     格式条款具有本法第五十二条和第五十三条规定情形的，或者提供格式条款一方免除其责任、加重对方责任、排除对方主要权利的，该条款无效。,"Article 40 When standard terms are under the circumstances stipulated in Article 52 and Article 53 of this Law, or the party which supplies the standard terms exempts itself from its liabilities, weights the liabilities of the other party, and excludes the rights of the other party, the terms shall be null and void. "
        第四十一条     对格式条款的理解发生争议的，应当按照通常理解予以解释。对格式条款有两种以上解释的，应当作出不利于提供格式条款一方的解释。格式条款和非格式条款不一致的，应当采用非格式条款。,"Article 41 If a dispute over the understanding of the standard terms occurs, it shall be interpreted according to general understanding. Where there are two or more kinds of interpretation, an interpretation unfavourable to the party supplying the standard terms shall be preferred. Where the standard terms are inconsistent with non-standard terms, the latter shall be adopted. "
        第四十二条     当事人在订立合同过程中有下列情形之一，给对方造成损失的，应当承担损害赔偿责任：,Article 42 The party shall be liable for damages if it is under one of the following circumstances in concluding a contract and thus causing losses to the other party: 
        （一）假借订立合同，恶意进行磋商；,"(1) disguising and pretending to conclude a contract, and negotiating in bad faith; "

        （三）有其他违背诚实信用原则的行为。,(3) performing other acts which violate the principle of good faith. 
        第四十三条     当事人在订立合同过程中知悉的商业秘密，无论合同是否成立，不得泄露或者不正当地使用。泄露或者不正当地使用该商业秘密给对方造成损失的，应当承担损害赔偿责任。,"Article 43 A business secret the parties learn in concluding a contract shall not be disclosed or unfairly used, not matter the contract is established or not. The party who causes the other party to suffer from losses due to disclosing or unfairly using the business secret shall be liable for damages."
          第三章     合同的效力, Chapter III Validity of the Contract
        第四十四条     依法成立的合同，自成立时生效。法律、行政法规规定应当办理批准、登记等手续生效的，依照其规定。,"Article 44 The contract established according to law becomes effective when it is established. With regard to contracts which are subject to approval or registration as provide for by the laws or administrative regulations, the provisions thereof shall be followed. "
        第四十五条     当事人对合同的效力可以约定附条件。附生效条件的合同，自条件成就时生效。附解除条件的合同，自条件成就时失效。当事人为自己的利益不正当地阻止条件成就的，视为条件已成就；不正当地促成条件成就的，视为条件不成就。,Article 45 The parties may agree on some collateral conditions relating to the effectiveness of a contract. The contract with entry-into-force conditions shall be effective when such conditions are accomplished. The contract with dissolving conditions shall be null and void when such conditions are accomplished. To unfairly prevent the conditions from being accomplished by one party for its own interests shall be regarded as those conditions have been accomplished. To unfairly promoting the accomplishment of such conditions by one party shall be regarded as non-accomplishment. 
        第四十六条     当事人对合同的效力可以约定附期限。附生效期限的合同，自期限届至时生效。附终止期限的合同，自期限届满时失效。,Article 46 The parties may agree on a conditional time period as to the effectiveness of the contract. A contract subject to an effective time period shall come into force when the period expires. A contract with termination time period shall become invalid when the period expires. 
        第四十七条     限制民事行为能力人订立的合同，经法定代理人追认后，该合同有效，但纯获利益的合同或者与其年龄、智力、精神健康状况相适应而订立的合同，不必经法定代理人追认。相对人可以催告法定代理人在一个月内予以追认。法定代理人未作表示的，视为拒绝追认。合同被追认之前，善意相对人有撤销的权利。撤销应当以通知的方式作出。,"Article 47 A contract concluded by a person with limited civil capacity of conduct shall be effective after being ratified afterwards by the person's statutory agent, but a pure profit-making contract or a contract concluded which is appropriate to the person's age, intelligence or mental health conditions need not be ratified by the person's statutory agent. The counterpart may urge the statutory agent to ratify the contract within one month. It shall be regarded as a refusal of ratification that the statutory agent does not make any expression. A bona fide counterpart has the right withdraw it before the contract is ratified. The withdrawal shall be made by means of notice. "
        第四十八条     行为人没有代理权、超越代理权或者代理权终止后以被代理人名义订立的合同，未经被代理人追认，对被代理人不发生效力，由行为人承担责任。相对人可以催告被代理人在一个月内予以追认。被代理人未作表示的，视为拒绝追认。合同被追认之前，善意相对人有撤销的权利。撤销应当以通知的方式作出。,"Article 48 A contract concluded by an actor who has no power of agency, who oversteps the power of agency, or whose power of agency has expired and yet concludes it on behalf of the principal, shall have no legally binding force on the principal without ratification by the principal, and the actor shall be held liable. The counterpart may urge the principal to ratify it within one month. It shall be regarded as a refusal of ratification that the principal does not make any expression. A bona fide counterpart has the right withdraw it before the contract is ratified. The withdrawal shall be made by means of notice. "
        第四十九条     行为人没有代理权、超越代理权或者代理权终止后以被代理人名义订立合同，相对人有理由相信行为人有代理权的，该代理行为有效。,"Article 49 If an actor has no power of agency, oversteps the power of agency, or the power of agency has expired and yet concludes a contract in the principal's name, and the counterpart has reasons to trust that the actor has the power of agency, the act of agency shall be effective. "
        第五十条     法人或者其他组织的法定代表人、负责人超越权限订立的合同，除相对人知道或者应当知道其超越权限的以外，该代表行为有效。,"Article 50 Where a atatutory representative or a responsible person of a legal person or other organization oversteps his/her power and concludes a contract, the representative act shall be effective except that the counterpart knows or ought to know that he/she is overstepping his/her powers. "
        第五十一条     无处分权的人处分他人财产，经权利人追认或者无处分权的人订立合同后取得处分权的，该合同有效。,"Article 51 Where a person having no right to disposal of property disposes of other persons' properties, and the principal ratifies the act afterwards or the person without power of disposal has obtained the power after concluding a contract, the contract shall be valid. "

        一方以欺诈、胁迫的手段或者乘人之危，使对方在违背真实意思的情况下订立的合同，受损害方有权请求人民法院或者仲裁机构变更或者撤销。,"If a contract is concluded by one party against the other party's true intentions through the use of fraud, coercion or exploitation of the other party's unfavorable position. The injured party shall have the right to request the people's court or an arbitration institution to modify or revoke it. "
        当事人请求变更的，人民法院或者仲裁机构不得撤销。,"Where a party requests for modification, the people's court or the arbitration institution may not revoke the contract. "

        第五十六条     无效的合同或者被撤销的合同自始没有法律约束力。合同部分无效，不影响其他部分效力的，其他部分仍然有效。,"Article 56 A contract that is null and void or revoked shall have no legally binding force ever from the very beginning. If part of a contract is null and void without affecting the validity of the other parts, the other parts shall still be valid. "
        第五十七条     合同无效、被撤销或者终止的，不影响合同中独立存在的有关解决争议方法的条款的效力。,"Article 57 If a contract is null and void, revoked or terminated, it shall not affect the validity of the dispute settlement clause which is independently existing in the contract. "
        第五十八条     合同无效或者被撤销后，因该合同取得的财产，应当予以返还；不能返还或者没有必要返还的，应当折价补偿。有过错的一方应当赔偿对方因此所受到的损失，双方都有过错的，应当各自承担相应的责任。,"Article 58 The property acquired as a result of a contract shall be returned after the contract is confirmed to be null and void or has been revoked.
