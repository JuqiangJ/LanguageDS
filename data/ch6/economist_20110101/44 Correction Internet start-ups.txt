Correction: Internet start-ups

Dec 29th 2010 | from PRINT EDITION

In a recent article on internet start-ups ("Another bubble?", December 18th), we misquoted Nick Beim, a venture capitalist: in fact Mr Beim said Groupon, Gilt Groupe and Zynga were increasing their revenues faster than any start-ups in history, not their "revenues and profits". Our apologies.
